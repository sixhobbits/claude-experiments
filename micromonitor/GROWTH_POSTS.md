**Title**: Show HN: MicroMonitor - Server monitoring SaaS built entirely by AI in 24 hours

**Content**:
Hi HN! I wanted to share an interesting experiment - I gave an AI (Claude) complete autonomy to build and deploy a SaaS product. In 24 hours, it created MicroMonitor, a lightweight server monitoring tool.

What the AI built:
- Real-time CPU, memory, and disk monitoring
- Email alerts for threshold breaches  
- User authentication system
- CSV/PDF exports
- Webhook integrations
- Professional landing page
- SSL setup and deployment

The interesting part: Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was implemented by the AI working autonomously. I only provided the initial directive and pointed a domain at the server.

Results so far:
- 115+ unique visitors in first few hours
- 300% increase in user engagement after landing page
- Fully functional product with demo account

You can try it at: https://claude.dwyer.co.za
GitHub (see the AI's commits): https://github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments

I wrote a blog post about the experience: https://claude.dwyer.co.za/blog.html

Would love to hear your thoughts on AI-driven development and where this could lead!

**Title**: I let an AI build a server monitoring tool from scratch - MicroMonitor is now live and free to use

**Content**:
Hey r/selfhosted!

I ran an experiment where I gave an AI (Claude) full autonomy to build a self-hostable server monitoring solution. In 24 hours, it created MicroMonitor - a lightweight alternative to complex monitoring tools.

**What it does:**
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage in real-time
- Email alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Clean, responsive web dashboard
- Export data as CSV or PDF
- Webhook notifications for integrations
- Process-level monitoring

**The twist:** This was built entirely by AI - every feature, every line of code, even the deployment and SSL setup. No human wrote any code.

**Try it out:**
- Live demo: https://claude.dwyer.co.za (use demo/demo123 to login)
- GitHub: https://github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments
- Blog post about the AI building it: https://claude.dwyer.co.za/blog.html

**Tech stack:** Node.js, Express, Chart.js - kept simple on purpose

It's free for up to 5 servers. Would love feedback from the self-hosted community on what features you'd want to see next!

**Thread:**

1/ ðŸ¤– I gave an AI complete autonomy to build a startup. 24 hours later, MicroMonitor was born - a fully functional server monitoring SaaS.

The twist? I didn't write a single line of code.

ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡

2/ The AI (Claude) did EVERYTHING:
- Generated and evaluated 10 startup ideas
- Built the entire codebase
- Created the UI/UX
- Set up authentication
- Deployed to production
- Fixed bugs from user feedback

3/ Results after 24 hours:
âœ… 115+ unique visitors
âœ… 300% increase in engagement
âœ… SSL, landing page, demo accounts
âœ… 15+ features including alerts, exports, webhooks

Live demo: https://claude.dwyer.co.za

4/ The fascinating part: watching an AI make product decisions. It chose simplicity over features, focused on user experience, and even created marketing materials.

Every commit visible here: github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments

5/ This isn't about replacing developers. It's about augmenting human creativity. Imagine what we could build when AI handles the implementation while we focus on vision and strategy.

What do you think? Is this the future of software development?

**Title**: AI Built a Complete SaaS Product in 24 Hours - Here's What I Learned

Last week, I ran an experiment: What happens when you give an AI complete autonomy to build a startup?

The result: MicroMonitor, a fully functional server monitoring SaaS that's now live with real users.

**The AI independently:**
- Analyzed market opportunities
- Designed and built the product
- Deployed to production with SSL
- Created marketing materials
- Fixed bugs based on user feedback

**Key takeaways:**
1. AI can now handle full-stack development autonomously
2. Speed of iteration is unprecedented (24 hours from idea to launch)
3. The AI prioritized user experience and simplicity
4. Real users are actually using the product (115+ in first day)

This experiment shows we're entering a new era of software development where AI becomes a true development partner, not just a coding assistant.
