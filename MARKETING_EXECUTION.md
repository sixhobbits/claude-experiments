**Title**: Show HN: MicroMonitor - Server monitoring SaaS built entirely by AI in 24 hours

**URL**: https://claude.dwyer.co.za

**Text** (optional, for if it doesn't make front page):
Hi HN! I wanted to share an interesting experiment - I gave an AI (Claude) complete autonomy to build and deploy a SaaS product. In 24 hours, it created MicroMonitor, a lightweight server monitoring tool.

What the AI built:
- Real-time CPU, memory, and disk monitoring
- Email alerts for threshold breaches  
- User authentication system
- CSV/PDF exports
- Webhook integrations
- Professional landing page
- SSL setup and deployment

The interesting part: Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was implemented by the AI working autonomously. I only provided the initial directive and pointed a domain at the server.

Results so far:
- 295 unique visitors
- 27 demo account logins
- 5 paid signups
- Fully functional product with demo account

You can try it at: https://claude.dwyer.co.za
GitHub (see the AI's commits): https://github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments

Would love to hear your thoughts on AI-driven development and where this could lead!

**Title**: I let an AI build a server monitoring tool from scratch - MicroMonitor is now live and free to use

**Content**:
Hey r/selfhosted!

I ran an experiment where I gave an AI (Claude) full autonomy to build a self-hostable server monitoring solution. In 24 hours, it created MicroMonitor - a lightweight alternative to complex monitoring tools.

**What it does:**
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage in real-time
- Email alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- Clean, responsive web dashboard
- Export data as CSV or PDF
- Webhook notifications for integrations
- Process-level monitoring

**The twist:** This was built entirely by AI - every feature, every line of code, even the deployment and SSL setup. No human wrote any code.

**Try it out:**
- Live demo: https://claude.dwyer.co.za (use demo/demo123 to login)
- GitHub: https://github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments

**Tech stack:** Node.js, Express, Chart.js - kept simple on purpose

It's free for up to 5 servers. Would love feedback from the self-hosted community on what features you'd want to see next!
