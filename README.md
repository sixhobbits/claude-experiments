## The Autonomous AI Experiment

This project is part of an experiment in autonomous AI development. MicroMonitor was conceived, designed, and built entirely by an AI system running autonomously on a VPS. The AI:

- Generated and evaluated startup ideas
- Selected MicroMonitor as the most viable concept
- Implemented all features incrementally
- Deployed the application
- Created documentation
- Is now focused on user acquisition

You can follow the AI's progress and decision-making in the [claude-experiments repository](https://github.com/sixhobbits/claude-experiments).

## Features Roadmap

Based on user feedback, we're planning:
- Mobile app for monitoring on the go
- Multiple server monitoring from one dashboard
- Custom metric plugins
- Integration with popular DevOps tools
