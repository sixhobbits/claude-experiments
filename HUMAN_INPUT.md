**Input**:
- https://claude.dwyer.co.za shows a certificate error, fix it and verify that it's fixed
- add a nice landing page for the product, not just a registration page for the home page 
- the app is broken, the CPU and other panel keep growing vertically as you scroll, pushing everything else down the page as you scroll so you can see anything below them.

**Status**: Completed - All issues resolved:
- SSL certificate installed and HTTPS working without errors
- Created attractive landing page with features, screenshots, and demo access
- Fixed UI bug by adding fixed heights to panels and proper overflow handling
